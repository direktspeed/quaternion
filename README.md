# Quaternion Database
DIREKTSPEED AwesomeOS - Quaternion Database

The perfect Database as a Platform Solution
- Realtime Queries
- Realtime Replication
- Works Offline/Desynced Datacenter State 
- Supports all major WInterOP Runtimes
- Cross Datacenter Replication
- Cross Context Replication eg Mobile Devices / Browsers / Clusters.
- Ideal to Host your Own Cloud Deployments can replace solutions like Kubernets/Borg/Mesos/Docker/libcontainer/GraalVM/Couchbase/Oracle Database/Google Big Query/Elastic Search. You Name it. You can run indipendent services on each Database node or instance to scale horizontaly and verticaly. 
- Great Performance everywhere But World Leading Performance when running on a B8G Compiled Runtime created via just-build see demo benchmarks
  - See rank #1 - [just, in the composit Score](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r21&test=composite)
  - And the above example is really none optimized nothing it is just a poc of a Runtime Build and Linking Pattern. Unmodifed v8 is used in the just demo B8G is the highly Optimized V8 Engine Build created by the B8G Engine Runtime Builder it produces Highly Optimized Code with unmattered Performance not even massured at current point of time at scale but applying existing research knowleg this will outperform anything existing as it Produces System Arch Optimized Raw ASM in the highest optimized compiler mode.
- Easy to learn even incremental you can start with basic Javascript or Typescript Knowleg and Learn ECMAScript and Stealify Lang as you go.
- Supports Stealify Lang a ECMAScript Written Polyglot Implementation Framework drop in replacement for Any Language has same reasons as for example the [v8 torque lang](https://v8.dev/docs/torque).

## Ships with build in Migration in mind
As we know that you maybe use already Products in Your Cluster this is designed for Incremental InterOP from the ground up you can throw this into your Stack and remove it transprent from your Stack any Time. This does not Lock you into Something it only Applys the best known Concepts and gives you Incremental upgrade Pathes for your Software so it ships with everything needed to Create a Distributed Application or Platform of Any size that runs on all devices and servers from small to big with a Unifed way to integrate anything in a awesome way.

## Whats in the Quaternion Main Modules?
- StorageManagers, converts, methods.....
- localWebRTC for easy Development.
- otional payed Full Blown Web 4.0 Network Stack Based on WebRTC including custom ICE impmlementations. 
  - Using The ICE Protocol or ESMCE Protocol Which is a proprietary and Owned by DIREKTSPEED created by Frank Lemanschik.
